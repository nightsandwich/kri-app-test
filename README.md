# Research Management App

* I created this app while attending Fullstack Academy to address recurring needs at my job at a private investigation firm, and to practice backend functionality and Material UI.
* It maintains a database of research tools and websites used for various states and counties in the U.S. 
* It utilizes CRUD operations in RESTful API routes.
    * Each state and county has an optional summmary field, which can be edited.
    * Each state and county can have associated research sites with an optional note/description that can be edited and deleted.
* Additionally, a researcher can select which counties are relevant to their current project and produce a summary of everything they will need to research for that project.
